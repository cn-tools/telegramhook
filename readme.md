## telegramhook.tk :: Set Telegram Webhooks 

Here is ready to use vue.js project allowing user-friendly set telegram bots webhooks. Taken from Charles Okwuagwu's answer at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42554548/how-to-set-telegram-bot-webhook) and a bit improved.

### Usage

Use the demo or just clone this repo and open index.html file.

(If you need https with pem certificate.) Charles Okwuagwu:

```
I created a file on my server for conveniently setting up telegram webhooks.

You can use the same file on your server.

This should be on the same server from which you wish to run the Telegram Bot.

1. Drop this file on the same server you wish to host you bots

2. Ensure the mime-type for .pem is enabled on your webserver

3. Browse to this page on our server

4. Fill the form with your BOT_TOKEN and chosen PORT

5. Upload your certificate file

6. Submit the form
```

### Working Demo

Live demo could be found (and used) at [telegramhook.tk](http://telegramhook.tk). (NB: no https yet on my server, use with caution and be aware of MiTM.)

Instead of original link above (it doesn't work at this time), you could use [cn-tools.github.io/telegramhook](https://cn-tools.github.io/telegramhook)
